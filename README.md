# RegEx-with-Python
Regular Expressions with Python (Educative.io)


> To avoid bugs while dealing with regular expressions, we use raw strings as ```r'expression'```.

The re module in Python provides multiple methods to perform queries on an input string. Here are the most commonly used methods:

```python
re.match()
re.search()
re.split()
re.sub()
re.findall()
re.compile()
```


In case you do not know what’s this all about, it is a special sequence of characters or **pattern** that helps us to **match** or **find** other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in the UNIX world. This course assumes that you have basic understanding of the REGEX patterns, if you don’t, not to worry, we’ll introduce with some REGEX basics in the next lesson!
